This is a lightweight and fast language switcher.

== Description ==

This plugin allows a temporary change - only for the current page - of the language. It adds an item at the top right of the toolbar, so it is accessible on every page (backend and frontend).

The Language Switcher displays all languages that are installed.

The plugin contains a POT file and can be translated arbitrarily.

Remember: This plugin only translates the current page.
If you want to change your language permanently you have to do so in your profile.

== Installation ==

1. As admin go to the backend to the 'Plugins' menu and search for the text `url-lang-switcher`;.
2. Install the plugin and then activate it

= Installing manually: =

1. Unzip all files to the `wp-content/plugins/url-lang-switcher` directory
2. Log into WordPress admin and activate the 'URL Language Switcher' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use it? =

After you have activated the plugin, a toolbar item appears for each user at the top right of the page in the frontend as well as in the backend.

There you can select an installed language by clicking on it.

= How to install new languages ? =
Since Wordpress version 4.1 and higher you can install new languages automatically.
To do this, go as admin in the backend to the menu Settings -> General.
In the list of the field 'Website language' you can select any language, this will be downloaded/installed after saving if it does not already exist.
